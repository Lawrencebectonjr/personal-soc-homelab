# Personal SOC Home Lab

## Overview
This project documents the design, deployment, and hardening of a personal Security Operations Center (SOC) home lab using consumer hardware and open-source tools.

The goal is to demonstrate foundational SOC skills, including network visibility, host hardening, firewall configuration, logging, and attack surface reduction.

This is a personal learning project focused on:
- Linux administration
- Networking fundamentals
- Security monitoring
- Log analysis
- Detection engineering basics

## Lab Environment
- Ubuntu Server (Primary monitored host)
- HP Laptop (Attacker / Scanner / Analyst workstation)
- TP-Link Home Router
- UFW (Host-based firewall)
- Nmap (Network scanning & validation)

## Current Phase
Phase 4 – Network traffic & detection

## Objectives
- Establish network connectivity between hosts
- Validate host visibility and communication
- Identify exposed services
- Harden the server by reducing the attack surface
- Monitor and validate firewall activity via logs

## Progress Log
- [x] Verify all devices on same subnet
- [x] Confirm server IP stability
- [x] Enable SSH access
- [x] Establish ICMP connectivity (heartbeat)
- [x] Enable system logging (rsyslog)
- [x] Observe real-time authentication events
- [ ] Centralize logs
